# Custom EDR Evasion

Welcome to Custom EDR Evasion. This module of the workshop has two parts. The first, covers EDR evasion through the method that is used by EDR Sandblast to acheive the priveleges required to disable EDR called BYOD. or Bring Your Own Driver.  Then second part goes over different methods of evading EDR or operation on a device that has it, up to and including the concepts of de-hooking.

There is a lot of custom code here, most of it is pre compiled, which means you can just use the program without going through the compile steps, but the compile steps are provdied.  There is intetionally more than we will be able to cover in depth, but it hopefully provides you with inspiration, and a good baseline understanding of this kind of malware development.  The intetn is not to hand you fully function advanced malware, but rather to cover the concepts that advanced malware can/has/will leverage.
